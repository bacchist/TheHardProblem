We can develop a more precise taxonoomy of consciousness theories. A lot of stuff got dumped into "materialism" that don't quite fit with the definition given in the paper:

>Materialism is the claim that consciousness is entirely physical, solely the product of biological brains, and all mental states can be fully “reduced” to, or wholly explained by, physical states—which, at their deepest levels, are the fields and particles of fundamental physics. In short, materialism, in its many forms and flavors, gives a completely physicalist account of phenomenal consciousness."

This is a somewhat extreme position, and it's probably not fair to all the of thinkers presented to assume that they cling too tightly to this.

For example, Christopher Koch (developed the idea of Neural Correlates of Consciousness found in section 9.2.2) is actively grappling with the issue. A [recent discussion](https://youtu.be/qzwC7sXyhWQ?si=9htoR8L_osvaqPmz) he had with Bernardo Kastrup (an analytic idealist philosopher presented in section 16.4) highlights some of the critical issues that he is concerned with. Koch is prominent throughout the paper, and compares integrated information theory to panpsychism. 

Process theory as represented by Griffin in section 9.7.7 seems out of place. It belongs in closer proximity to Whitehead under panpsychism (in section 13.12). The author makes a puzzling distinction in order to leave it under the umbrella of materialism. I think it obscures things more than anything.

The author's description of Chomsky's views defies the materialist classification as well, "To Chomsky, a mechanical model of the world, developed in early modern philosophy and inchoate science, could never account for aspects of the mental."

How should psychological explanations be classified? Section 9.10.9 shows that "there is no hard problem" according to William James. I see some parralels to Minsky in James's depiction of a selection mechanism choosing between competing psychological evaluations.

William James' thought on the matter of consciousness and experience are deeper than suggested by the paper. Matthew David Segall [eloquently paraphrases James](https://footnotes2plato.com/2020/01/31/musing-on-consciousness-with-william-james-alfred-north-whitehead/) to say that experience "is the world’s way of weaving itself together".

I find there is deep resonance between many of the thinkers represented. Whitehead (13.12) and Teilhard (14.6) can probably be reconciled with each other in meaningful ways.

Particularly as it relates to the discussion of AI consciousness, Ilia Delio should be given more prominence. As a scholar of Teilhard, she is cited in the section addressing him. However, [her own thought](delio.md) is quite intriguing.

Panpsychism has a lot of overlap with various monisms. [Comparing Bertrand Russell to Alfred North Whitehead](russell_whitehead.md) brings out some of the nuances of different systems.

Obviously there are outliers and extreme positions, but as I spend more time with the paper, I am struck by just how much common ground there is between various thinkers. Sean Carroll is never going to evolve into an idealist, of course. However, there is a much fuller spectrum of thought than it seemed initially. Most of the ideas are just variations or restatements of adjacent concepts. The ideas don't cluster tightly around distinct and mutually exclusive descriptions. They rub up against and bleed into each other.
